# whiteboard
This is a repository of implementations for whiteboard questions that I've gotten during interviews.

So far, the goal is to account for the following interview questions:

* Shortest path on an undirected graph. - COMPLETE
* HashMap implementation. - COMPLETE
* Linked hash map (hash table that allows iteration over its keys in the order in which they were inserted). - COMPLETE
* Cartesian product of strings. - COMPLETE
* Postfix to infix arithmetic conversion. - COMPLETE
* Merge two sorted arrays of integers. - COMPLETE
* Reversal of a linked list. - COMPLETE
* Circularly linked list of parameterized type with support for null entries. - COMPLETE

## First goal complete.  Secondary goal follows.
In addition, I want to knock out some implementations of some basic data structure and algorithm problems, just to brush up.

* Dynamic array.
* Stack.
* Queue.
* Tree.
* Directed, acyclic graph.
* Heap.

* Binary search through an array.
* Dynamic programming (http://codercareer.blogspot.com/p/dynamic-interview-questions.html).
* Preorder and postorder traversal of a tree.
* Topological sorting of a directed, acyclic graph.
* Union-find.
* Bloom filter.
* Quicksort.
