## Milestone 1 - COMPLETE
This is a repository of implementations for whiteboard questions that I've gotten during interviews.

So far, the goal is to account for the following interview questions:

* Shortest path on an undirected graph. - COMPLETE
* HashMap implementation. - COMPLETE
* Linked hash map (hash table that allows iteration over its keys in the order in which they were inserted). - COMPLETE
* Cartesian product of strings. - COMPLETE
* Postfix to infix arithmetic conversion. - COMPLETE
* Merge two sorted arrays of integers. - COMPLETE
* Reversal of a linked list. - COMPLETE
* Circularly linked list of parameterized type with support for null entries. - COMPLETE

## Milestone 2 - COMPLETE
In addition, I want to knock out some implementations of some basic data structure and algorithm problems, just to brush up.

* Dynamic array (ArrayList). - COMPLETE
* Doubly Linked List (LinkedList). - COMPLETE
* Stack (ArrayDeque). - COMPLETE
* Queue (ArrayDeque). - COMPLETE
* Tree. - COMPLETE
* Directed acyclic graph. - COMPLETE
* Heap. - COMPLETE

Most of the above structures will be implemented in something very much like the corresponding Java interfaces.  I will be implementing against the interfaces as specified (abridged), but I will be deriving the implementations myself for practice.

The following algorithms will then be implemented, atop the above structures where necessary:

* Binary search through a list. - COMPLETE
* Dynamic programming (http://codercareer.blogspot.com/p/dynamic-interview-questions.html). - COMPLETE
* Preorder and postorder traversal of a tree. - COMPLETE
* Topological sorting of a directed, acyclic graph. - COMPLETE
* Union-find (disjoint set). - COMPLETE
* Bloom filter. - COMPLETE
* Quicksort. - COMPLETE

## Milestone 3

* Graph coloring. - COMPLETE
* LRU cache. - COMPLETE
* Chess move validator.
* Maybe something involving Swing, since that has come up a couple times.

## Milestone 4

* Something involving hashing function distribution, vis a vis numeric analysis.
