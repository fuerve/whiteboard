# whiteboard
This is a repository of implementations for whiteboard questions that I've gotten during interviews.

So far, the goal is to account for the following interview questions:

* Shortest path on an undirected graph.
* Linked hash map (hash table that allows iteration over its keys in the order in which they were inserted).
* Cartesian product of strings.
* Postfix to infix arithmetic conversion. - COMPLETE
* Merge two sorted arrays of integers. - COMPLETE
* Reversal of a linked list. - COMPLETE
* Circularly linked list of parameterized type with support for null entries.
